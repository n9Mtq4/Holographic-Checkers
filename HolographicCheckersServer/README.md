port = 8881  # the port of the server

def player1(msg):
    """ This is called every time player 1 send a message to the server"""
    print("player1: " + msg)
    # you can send messages back
    server.sendToPlayer1("sending a message to player 1")
    server.broadcast("message to all players")

def player2(msg):
    """ This is called every time player 2 send a message to the server"""
    print("player2: " + msg)
    server.sendToPlayer2("sending a message to player 2")

def setup():
    global server
    server = CheckerWebsocketServer(port, player1, player2)
    server.start()  # might need to do this in a thread
